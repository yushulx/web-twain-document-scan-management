# Dynamsoft Core Module

The Dynamsoft Core module builds the foundation upon which Dynamsoft SDKs implement their functionality. It consists of basic classes, interfaces and enumerations shared by all Dynamsoft SDKs compliant with the [DCV (Dynamsoft Capture Vision) architecture](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/architecture/index.html).
